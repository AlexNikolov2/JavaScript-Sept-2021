# Javascript - Autumn 2021

## How it all started

I decided to strengthen my skills, via creating more projects, based on JavaScript.
At first I planned to create the following applications:

*Weather App
*Global Clock
*To Do List
*Quiz App

## What actually happened

Turned out this was one of my most productive periods as a learning-to-be-a-programmer ever.
I have done 7 projects, and even managed to do well in my [JS Applications exam in Software University](https://softuni.bg/trainings/3488/js-applications-october-2021).

Here is a complete list of what was done:

Project Name  | Status
------------- | -------------
Weather App   | Done
Global Clock  | Done
To Do List    | Done
Quiz App      | Done
Calculator    | Done
Menu          | Done
Snake Game    | Done
Extended Weather App | HTML & CSS made, JS functionality needed
Beauty Salon  | Done

## Results

The work done in this period was very good.
I have learned a lot about JavaScript, and I had a lot of fun with it.
It had bring back my love to the language, and motivated me to do my best at the exam.
